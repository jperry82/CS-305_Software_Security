## Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Summary

### Client Overview
Artemis Financial, a firm engaged in international financial transactions, required a modernization of its operations with a strong focus on software security. The primary issue addressed was the safeguarding of their web-based applications to protect sensitive financial data, comply with international and domestic regulations, and ensure resilience against external threats.

### Key Accomplishments
My assessment pinpointed critical security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's web application, particularly in areas like input validation, authentication, and data protection. I excelled in identifying these vulnerabilities using a detailed manual review coupled with static testing. Secure coding is crucial as it prevents data breaches and maintains the integrity and confidentiality of information, adding immense value to the company's overall wellbeing by protecting its assets and reputation.

### Challenges and Learnings
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring comprehensive coverage of all potential security flaws without impacting the existing functionality of the application. This process was extremely helpful as it provided deep insights into the practical aspects of security implementation in real-world applications.

### Enhancements in Security Layers
To increase security layers, I implemented stricter input validations, improved error handling, and replaced hard-coded credentials with secure credential storage mechanisms. For future assessments, I plan to utilize updated tools like OWASP ZAP and continue employing static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

### Ensuring Functional and Secure Software
Post-refactoring, I ensured the application was both functional and secure by conducting rigorous regression testing and using tools like SonarQube to detect any new vulnerabilities introduced during code changes. This iterative testing and review process is critical to maintain and enhance security standards.

### Tools and Practices for Future Projects
Throughout this project, I utilized Dependency-Check tools, secure coding practices, and regular code reviews which proved invaluable. These practices will be incorporated into future assignments to continuously improve security posture and code quality.

### Demonstrating Skills to Employers
This project serves as a strong example of my ability to critically analyze and improve software security in a financial context. I would showcase the detailed vulnerability assessment, the mitigation steps implemented, and the comprehensive documentation prepared as proof of my skills in secure software development.
